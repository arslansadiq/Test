    "<p>The above code-block creates an <code>vtkSphereSource</code> object which creates a sphere represented by polygons. We use the <code>SetCenter</code> and <code>SetRadius</code> to set the coordinates of the center to the (0, 0, 0) origin of the cartesian system and set the radius of the sphere to 10.0. The <code>SetThetaResolution</code> and <code>SetPhiResolution</code> methods set the number of points in the longitude and latitude directions respectively.

We then use the same <code>SetInputConnection</code> and <code>GetOutputPort</code> pipeline mechanism we saw in the previously.</p>\n",
    "<p>Lastly, remember how our <code>vtk_show</code> function needs a <code>vtkRenderer</code> instance to function? Well now we have it so all we need to do is call that function as such <code>vtk_show(VtkRenderer)</code>. We could define the width and height of the rendering through a call like <code>vtk_show(VtkRenderer, width=100, height=200)</code> but we won’t bother.

    "    <p>Upon first inspection, one might think that 3D NumPy arrays weren’t possible to convert. However, all that one needs to do is create a 1D representation of the array using ‘numpy.ndarray’ methods such as <code>flatten</code> or <code>ravel</code>. So here’s how to use this function assuming you mean to export an <code>numpy.ndarray</code> object named <code>NumPy_data</code> of type <code>float32</code> :</p><br>\n",
    "    <code>NumPy_data_shape = NumPy_data.shape\n",
    "VTK_data = numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(num_array=NumPy_data.ravel(), deep=True, array_type=vtk.VTK_FLOAT)</code><br>\n",
    "<p>As you can see we use <code>ravel</code> to flatten NumPy_data using the default <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order\">C, or row-major, ordering</a> (especially important on 2D and 3D arrays). In addition, we specify that we do want the data to be deep-copied by setting deep=True, while we also define the data type by <code>array_type=vtk.VTK_FLOAT</code>. Note, that we keep a copy of the shape of NumPy_data which we will use later to reshape the result of <code>vtk_to_numpy</code>. Converting back is much easier and can be done as such:</p><br>\n",
    "<code>NumPy_data = numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(VTK_data)\n",
    "NumPy_data = NumPy_data.reshape(NumPy_data_shape)</code><br>\n",
    "<em>CAUTION: You may choose to allow for shallow-copies by setting deep=False but be warned: If for any reason, the array you pass is garbage-collected then the link will break and your nice VTK array will be useless. Should that occur, if you end up using vtk_to_numpy to back-convert, you will simply get memory trash. That is especially the case if you use flatten instead of ravel as the former always returns a ‘flattened’ copy of the array (check docs <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flatten.html\">here</a>) which is bound to get gc’ed if you use it directly in the call. ravel is slightly safer as it typically returns a new ‘view’ to the array and only copies when it has to (check docs <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ravel.html\">here</a>) but you don’t want to depend on that. Bottom line: disable deep-copying at your own risk and only if you know what you’re doing.</em>\n",
    "<h4>Using the PyEVTK package</h4>\n",
    "<p>What PyEVTK does, is allow you to save NumPy arrays straight to different types of VTK <a href=\"https://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf\">XML-based file formats</a> (not the old legacy ones), without even needing to have VTK installed in your system, making NumPy the only dependency. This way, you can easily save your NumPy arrays into files that can be visualized and processed with any of the flagship VTK applications such as ParaView, VisIt, Mayavi, while obviously you can easily load said files with VTK and use all the goodies the toolkit offers.</p><br>\n",

    "gridToVTK(\"./julia\", x, y, z, cellData = {'julia': juliaStacked})</code>\n",
    "<p>The first important part of this code is from <code>pyevtk.hl import gridToVTK</code> which uses the high-level functions of the <code>pyevtk</code> package and which reside under the <code>pyevtk.hl</code> module. For the most-part, this module has all you need but the package also provides a <code>pyevtk.vtk</code> module for low-level calls. As we want to export data residing on a rectilinear grid we use the <code>gridToVTK</code> method.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>The next 5 lines aren’t important but what we do is use the <code>numpy.dstack</code> function to stack 5 copies of the <code>2D julia</code> array and create a 3D array to export. Note the <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html\">numpy.arange</a> calls through which we calculate ‘fake’ axes for the array to be exported. An important point to make is that since we’re defining a grid we need axes with N+1 coordinates which define the grid edges (as the data resides in the centers of that grid). If you want to export point-data, use the <code>pyevtk.hl.pointsToVTK</code> function.</p>\n",
    "<p>As you guessed the magic happens with this one line</p><br>\n",
    "<code>gridToVTK(\"./julia\", x, y, z, cellData = {'julia': juliaStacked})</code><br>\n",
    "<p>As you can see, we pass the path to the file <b>without an extension</b> which will be automatically defined by PyEVTK depending on which function you used in order to create the appropriate VTK file.
